# Generating TypeScript Types for Supabase

Since the `types.ts` file is read-only in your project, you need to generate the types using the Supabase CLI. Follow these steps:

1. Install the Supabase CLI if you haven't already:
```bash
npm install -g supabase
```

2. Login to Supabase:
```bash
supabase login
```

3. Generate the types (replace YOUR_PROJECT_REF with your project reference):
```bash
supabase gen types typescript --project-id vkvyucifczyhfycdljvk --schema public > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
```

4. Alternatively, you can use the Supabase dashboard to generate types:
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vkvyucifczyhfycdljvk
   - Navigate to API > TypeScript
   - Copy the generated types
   - Paste into src/integrations/supabase/types.ts

Once the types are generated, the TypeScript errors should be resolved.
